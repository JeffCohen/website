IMPORTANT NOTES:

 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/jeffcohenonline.com/fullchain.pem. Your cert
   will expire on 2016-09-09. To obtain a new version of the
   certificate in the future, simply run Certbot again.
 - If you lose your account credentials, you can recover through
   e-mails sent to cohen.jeff@gmail.com.
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
