    %h3 Cost
    %p
      Because I customize all course material to fit your current interests, your cost is
      based on course content, not the number of attendees - so put as many people
      in the room as you'd like.  I can travel anywhere in the USA and UK.  Your cost is
      independent of your location, because all travel expenses are on me.
