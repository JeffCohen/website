# Context is Everything

Software developers who venture into mentorship quickly discover that coaching technical
staff it takes more than superior technical know-how to be a good mentor.

Engineers who want to be effective teachers must first become familiar with how people learn.  
It's actually a deep subject that's an entire field unto itself, but you don't have to 
get a degree in education or the cognitive sciences to become an effective mentor.

The best place is to start is to understand the following:

> We only learn something new by its relationship to something we already know.

Define: Zone of Proximal Development

The biggest mistake instructors make at this point is to begin the session by starting to introduce the next, most adjacent thing to what they know.  Instead, our beginner-focused approach recommends that the teacher start with what the student already knows.  We call this From Zero.  Itâ€™s not necessary to go into much depth. Just enough to get their memory juiced up.  This increase their _initial confidence_ which is extremely important to have when you segue into the next zone.

Step Zero can be a simple review, like a quick demo or time-boxed ice-breaker challenge: very brief, but just long enough to get them engaged with the material.

Starting from Zero ensures that the student has the context necessary for traveling to the next zone.  Without this context, some students may be able to keep up, but this is an area where some beginners will completely tune out if they feel left behind right at the beginning of the session.

One way to create a challenge that is not identical to a class demo is to simply remove a bit of context.  Reconstructing the context that would be necessary to understand a certain set of instructions or solve a particular problem tends to lead to cognitive growth, and helps the student gain confidence with external materials that do not provide as much contextual guidance.
