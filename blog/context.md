# Context is Everything

Software developers who venture into mentorship quickly discover that coaching technical
staff it takes more than superior technical know-how to be a good mentor.

Engineers who want to be effective teachers must first become familiar with how people learn.  

It's actually a deep subject that's an entire field unto itself, but you don't have to 
get a degree in education or the cognitive sciences to become an effective mentor.

The best place is to start is to grasp the following: _context is everything_.

Imagine using Google Maps to get driving directions to Wrigley Field.  Now suppose
that instead of starting from your current position, it gave directions from 
a random location instead.

That wouldn't be very helpful, right?  To get somewhere, you need guidance
starting from the place where you are right now.   Turn-by-turn directions are useless if they start from the wrong place.

As a teacher, we have to know where our students are starting from.
I have to really empathize with the mind of the student, and 
really understand where they're at.  Only
then can I make a plan a route for getting them to where they want to be.

In 1978, psychologist Lev Vygotsky introduced the notion of the _Zone of Proximal Development_, sometimes referred to as learning adjacency.  It's a key idea that's especially apparent when working with junior: the brain can only learn by making connections to what it already knows.  Learning something always happens in the context of what is known so far. 

In order for someone to learn a new concept, technique, or skill, it must be reachable from the knowledge they already have.  And the gap between the tip of their current knowledge and the new knowledge they wish to attain must be very small.

We know this intuitively: once we have learned 4th grade algebra, jumping to differential calculus is not going to be possible.  Instead, we learn 5th grade algebra, which is a smaller step and more likely to be integrated into our current knowledge.  

The biggest mistake new teachers is to construct a sequence that makes sense to the _teacher_, not to the student. This is a very hard thing for most teachers to overcome.  We must remember that we already have the knowledge, and so the instruction sequence will, by defintion, "make sense" to us.  But it might not make sense to someone who hasn't learned the material at all.

One way to become a better mentor is a technique that I call _Step Zero_, in which
the first thing we teach isn't actually anything
new at all, but rather a repeat of what the student knows already.

Starting from Zero ensures that the student and teacher share the same context. This context is necessary for traveling to the next adjacent zone.  

Here's an example:

So remember, the key to growing in your teaching and mentoring skills is to recognize the crucial role that context plays in every learning experience.  Understanding a student's context requires empathy, and an uncanny ability to remember what it felt like before you knew what you know.
