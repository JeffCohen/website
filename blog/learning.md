# Learning How To Learn

Teachers everywhere face a tragic, unspoken expectation from their students: _please transfer your knowledge into our brain._  This expectation is wrong and often leads to harmful outcomes.

Even worse, many teachers actually strive to fulfill this expectation.  

And why not?  If you're good at explaining a concept, and if the students listen attentively, brain transfer should occur. And anything that doesn't become crystal clear will certainly be cleared up when the students ask questions for anything somehow remained a bit fuzzy.  

Sounds pretty easy, right?

Except it's not.  And it never is.

Because knowledge transfer is almost always the wrong goal in the first place.

As a teacher, my goal is not that the students will have learned the factual material that came looking for.  Instead, all of my energy is directed at expanding their capacity to learn new things. And I don't just want to expand it by a little.  I want to expand it by such fantastic extent that they are in fact _glad_ when they can  finally done with me, having already started learning new things on their own.

This kind of self-obsolescence drives all of my decisions and actions. 

Whenever I to decide whether or not a particular lecture, homework assignment, or lab session is necessary, I test it against my prime directive: 

_Will it propel students toward self-sufficiency?_

I teach courses in software design and computation.  Our school system has conditioned students to want to memorize facts, and it’s important for me not to feed that habit. Facts and trivia are easily retrieved from a Google search. 

It is for this reason that facts hold little value in my class.  Where I focus instead is on the _learning process_. 

In today's economy, learning _how to learn more_ is the only goal that makes any sense at all.  Technology constantly changes. One programming language will not provide skills that will last. Neither will two. Nor five.

So what does last? If transferring facts from my brain to theirs is only a short-term solution, what's better?

This is what's better: equipping students so they know

* how to solve problems
* how to troubleshoot 
* how to read technical specifications
* how to use both inductive and deductive reasoning
* how to interpret online articles and tutorials 

These are the skills that never get old because they enable people to adapt to new situations, learn new things whenever they need, and to succeed in their work.  And that's the real reason why they came into my classroom in the first place.
