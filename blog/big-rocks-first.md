# Big Rocks First

Learning something new for the first time is often challenging.  Observe 
an American trying to learn the game of cricket; or someone from the UK trying
to grasp the often unituitive rules of baseball.  When faced with unfamiliar 
information, we strain ourselves to form a mental model of the thing we
are trying to learn, in order to have it all "make sense." 

Courses in a highly technical field, such as computer programming, can pose 
a particularly difficult challenge.  Most programming concepts cannot be fully 
understood in a single sitting, or even a single day.  And when faced with learning an 
entire system or framework, that will likely require many days or weeks or
even months of incrementl learning, the challenge for the teacher is at its highest.
What is the best way to cover all of the necessary material such that, by the end of the course, the student will have mastered everything?

## The Ideal is Only An Ideal

Here is a graph of a web development student’s ideal progress over time:

</p>

But this never happens, because _it can't happen_.  Presenting
any substantive amount of material in a purely linear fashion
cannot possibly work.   Each topic is too complex to master
completely the first time around.  We wouldn't want to teach
every detail of HTML5 before learning any CSS.

Even within a single topic like HTML, 
we can't present everything there is to know about HTML in a linear fashion.  The edge cases and variations would overwhelm the main
ideas that must be mastered first.

## Rocks, Sand, and a Jar

I first encountered this puzzle watching a Bill Nye episode a long time ago:

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  
  You have an empty jar, a half-jar’s worth of fine-grained sand, and a bunch of big rocks. The rocks will easily fit through the mouth of the jar, and take up less than half the volume of the jar.

  Unfortunately, the rocks won’t stack nicely. They take up 7/8 of the height of the jar even though they will use less than half the volume.

  *How would you fit all the rocks and sand into the jar?*

</blockquote>

The solution to this puzzle is also the answer to how to sequence new material: _go with the big rocks first_. They will take up 3/4 of the height of the jar but less than half the volume. Then simply pour the fine-grained sand around the rocks, and everything will fit.

Some things are important to learn right now. Other things are not.

For every topic, textbook chapter, or new idea, there is one main concept that is important. That’s my big rock. That goes first.

There are other things the students must learn that are smaller. That’s my sand. It goes in last.

I must not allow my students to spend their attention on the minor details. If students fill their memory capacity with minutia, they won’t have room for the big concepts.

I deliver the big concept first while limiting details. I make sure they get the big idea first. I pretend the details don’t exist. I don’t indulge questions from students who want to run ahead to unnecessary details until they demonstrate that they get the big concept first. I lie if I have to, to make sure they focus on the rock. Then, they will have sufficient context and space for smaller ideas and facts.

The next time you’re teaching a new topic, idea, or section in a textbook, work hard to identify the biggest rock. (Typical math and science textbooks don’t do this very well, so you’ll need to improvise.) Cut through the noise of tedious problems, and help the students focus on the main idea.

Get that big rock into their mental jar first. Then the pebbles and grains of sand
will surely find a place to fit.
